# Story 1.2: Initialize Git Repository and Deploy to GitHub

## Status
**Approved**

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** the project tracked in Git and hosted on GitHub,
**so that** I have version control and can enable automated deployments.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Git repository initialized with initial commit
2. Repository created on GitHub (public or private per user preference)
3. Local repository connected to GitHub remote
4. Initial codebase pushed to GitHub main branch
5. `.gitignore` prevents committing node_modules, .env files, and build artifacts
6. Repository includes descriptive README with project overview

---

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Initialize Git repository (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Run `git init` in project root
  - [ ] Verify .gitignore exists and is properly configured
  - [ ] Stage all files: `git add .`
  - [ ] Create initial commit with message: "Initial commit - Next.js 14 project setup"
  - [ ] Verify commit created: `git log`

- [ ] Create GitHub repository (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create new repository on GitHub (ask user for public/private preference)
  - [ ] Repository name: `cat-care-hub` (or user preference)
  - [ ] Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (already exists locally)
  - [ ] Copy repository URL (HTTPS or SSH)

- [ ] Connect local repository to GitHub (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Add GitHub as remote: `git remote add origin <repository-url>`
  - [ ] Verify remote: `git remote -v`
  - [ ] Push to GitHub: `git push -u origin main`
  - [ ] Verify push succeeded

- [ ] Verify .gitignore configuration (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Confirm `node_modules/` is excluded
  - [ ] Confirm `.env*` files are excluded (except .env.example)
  - [ ] Confirm `.next/` build artifacts are excluded
  - [ ] Confirm `dist/`, `out/`, `build/` are excluded
  - [ ] Test by checking GitHub - these folders should NOT appear

- [ ] Verify repository documentation (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Confirm README.md exists in repository root
  - [ ] Confirm README includes:
    - Project title and description
    - Tech stack overview
    - Setup instructions
    - Development commands
  - [ ] View repository on GitHub and verify README displays correctly

- [ ] Final verification
  - [ ] Clone repository to temporary directory to verify it works
  - [ ] Run `npm install` in cloned repo
  - [ ] Run `npm run dev` to ensure project runs from fresh clone
  - [ ] Delete temporary directory after verification

## Dev Notes

### Git Configuration

**Repository Structure:**
- **Main branch:** `main` (default)
- **Branch strategy:** Trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches
- **Commit messages:** Descriptive, present tense (e.g., "Add Contentful integration")

**Pre-commit Checklist (for future commits):**
```bash
npm run lint    # Check for linting errors
npm run format  # Auto-format code
npm run build   # Ensure build succeeds
```

### GitHub Repository Settings

**Recommended settings after creation:**
- **Repository name:** `cat-care-hub` or `cat-website-project`
- **Visibility:** User's choice (public or private)
- **Description:** "Modern cat care and education hub built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Contentful CMS"
- **Topics (optional):** `nextjs`, `typescript`, `tailwindcss`, `contentful`, `jamstack`, `cats`

### .gitignore Verification

The following should already be in `apps/web/.gitignore` from Story 1.1:

```gitignore
# Dependencies
/node_modules

# Next.js
/.next/
/out/

# Production
/build

# Env files
.env*
!.env.example

# Misc
.DS_Store
*.pem

# Debug logs
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*

# TypeScript
*.tsbuildinfo
next-env.d.ts

# Vercel
.vercel
```

**Additional root .gitignore (if needed):**
- May need to create root `.gitignore` for monorepo-specific exclusions
- Workspace node_modules already excluded by apps/web/.gitignore

### Initial Commit Message

```
Initial commit - Next.js 14 project setup

- Initialize Next.js 14.2.5 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS 3.4
- Set up monorepo structure with npm workspaces (apps/web, packages/shared)
- Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Add environment variable template (.env.example)
- Create comprehensive README with setup instructions

Story: 1.1
```

### GitHub Remote URL Formats

**HTTPS (easier for beginners):**
```
https://github.com/username/cat-care-hub.git
```

**SSH (recommended if SSH keys configured):**
```
git@github.com:username/cat-care-hub.git
```

### Testing

**Manual Testing:**
1. Verify Git status shows clean working tree
2. Verify GitHub repository shows all files
3. Verify .env files are NOT in repository
4. Verify node_modules are NOT in repository
5. Verify cloning and installing works from fresh directory

**No automated tests required** - this is repository setup

### Important Notes

- **Do NOT commit .env.local** - contains secrets
- **Do commit .env.example** - template for others
- **Verify before pushing** - ensure no sensitive data in commits
- **Branch protection** - will be set up later with Vercel integration (Story 1.7)

### Future Stories Dependencies

Story 1.7 (Deploy to Vercel) will:
- Connect Vercel to this GitHub repository
- Enable automatic deployments on push to main
- Enable preview deployments for pull requests
