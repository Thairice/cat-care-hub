# Cat Care & Education Hub Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Provide cat owners with accessible, reliable educational content on essential care tasks (nail trimming, grooming, behavior understanding)
- Create a professional, interactive web application that stands out from low-quality pet care websites
- Build a centralized resource that reduces information fragmentation for cat owners
- Deliver curated product recommendations that help users make informed purchasing decisions
- Establish a trusted platform that drives organic traffic and user engagement
- Launch MVP within 3-4 months with at least 10 educational topics and 50 gallery images

### Background Context

Cat owners face significant challenges in finding trustworthy, actionable care guidance. Information is scattered across multiple sources with varying quality, and many existing cat care websites prioritize ad revenue over user experience, resulting in cluttered interfaces. With pet ownership increasing post-pandemic, there's a growing need for quality educational resources that combine practical care instructions with visual demonstrations and reliable product recommendations.

The Cat Care & Education Hub addresses this gap by providing an interactive web application with a visual-first approach, featuring step-by-step guides, photo galleries, and curated product suggestions—all in a professionally designed interface that builds trust and credibility.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will use a **monorepo structure** with all code (frontend, backend utilities, shared types, and configuration) in a single repository.

**Rationale:** For a solo developer or small team with a 3-4 month timeline, a monorepo simplifies dependency management, enables code sharing between frontend and backend, and streamlines deployment. This approach reduces complexity and allows for faster iteration during MVP development.

### Service Architecture

**JAMstack Architecture with Headless CMS:**
- **Frontend:** React-based static site generation or server-side rendering (Next.js recommended for its built-in optimizations, routing, and SEO capabilities)
- **Content Management:** Headless CMS (options: Strapi self-hosted, Contentful, or Sanity) for managing articles, images, and product recommendations
- **Static Assets:** Images hosted via CDN (Cloudinary or similar) for optimization and fast delivery
- **APIs:** RESTful or GraphQL API from headless CMS; minimal custom API endpoints if needed
- **Deployment:** Static generation where possible with ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for content updates

**Rationale:** JAMstack architecture provides excellent performance (pre-rendered pages), strong SEO (server-rendered content), and scalability. Headless CMS separates content management from presentation, making it easier to update articles and products without code deployments. Next.js + React provides the interactive features needed while maintaining professional performance standards.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing Only for MVP:**
- Framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- Coverage: Critical business logic, utility functions, and key React components
- Focus: Test reusable components, content rendering logic, search functionality
- E2E and integration tests deferred to post-MVP

**Rationale:** Given the 3-4 month timeline and bootstrap budget, unit testing provides the best ROI for MVP. It catches regressions in core functionality while allowing rapid development. More comprehensive testing (integration, E2E) can be added in Phase 2 once MVP validates product-market fit.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Frontend Framework:** React with Next.js for SSR/SSG capabilities, built-in routing, image optimization, and SEO features
- **Styling:** CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS for maintainable, responsive styling with professional appearance
- **State Management:** React Context API or Zustand for lightweight state management (avoid Redux complexity for MVP)
- **Image Optimization:** Next.js Image component + CDN (Cloudinary free tier) for automatic optimization, lazy loading, and responsive images
- **Analytics:** Privacy-focused analytics (Plausible or Simple Analytics) or Google Analytics 4
- **Search Implementation:** Client-side search for MVP (libraries like Fuse.js or Lunr.js); can upgrade to Algolia or similar if traffic grows
- **SEO:** Next.js built-in SEO features + meta tags, sitemap generation, structured data for rich snippets
- **Deployment Platform:** Vercel (optimized for Next.js, generous free tier, automatic deployments from Git, built-in CDN)
- **Version Control:** Git with GitHub (enables Vercel auto-deployments and collaboration)
- **Headless CMS Options:**
  - **Strapi** (self-hosted, fully customizable, free, but requires hosting)
  - **Contentful** (managed service, generous free tier, excellent DX, recommended for MVP)
  - **Sanity** (managed service, real-time collaboration, customizable, good free tier)
  - *Recommendation: Contentful for MVP due to ease of setup and generous free tier*
- **Environment Management:** Environment variables for API keys, CMS credentials, analytics tokens
- **Code Quality:** ESLint + Prettier for consistent code formatting
- **Accessibility:** Built-in React accessibility best practices, semantic HTML, ARIA labels where needed (WCAG AA compliance)
- **Browser Support:** Latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (as specified in NFR2)
- **Performance Budget:** Lighthouse score targets - Performance: 90+, Accessibility: 90+, Best Practices: 90+, SEO: 90+

**Technology Stack Summary:**
```
Frontend: React + Next.js + TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Content: Contentful (Headless CMS)
Image Hosting: Cloudinary
Deployment: Vercel
Repository: GitHub (Monorepo)
Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
Analytics: Plausible or GA4

### Top Issues by Priority

#### BLOCKERS
None identified.

#### HIGH
None identified.

#### MEDIUM
1. **Visual Documentation:** Consider adding user flow diagrams or architecture diagrams in future iterations to enhance clarity for visual learners
2. **User Feedback Mechanism:** While analytics are covered (Story 4.3), consider adding a lightweight feedback widget or survey mechanism in post-MVP to gather qualitative user insights

#### LOW
1. **Backup/Recovery Strategy:** For MVP on Vercel with Contentful, automatic backups are handled by platforms. Document recovery procedures post-MVP if needed
2. **Integration Testing:** While unit tests are specified, integration tests are deferred to post-MVP. This is appropriate for scope but should be revisited in Phase 2

### MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Evaluation:** The MVP scope is appropriately minimal while remaining viable.

**Strengths:**
- Clear focus on core value proposition: educational content + visual learning + product recommendations
- Out-of-scope items (user accounts, community, video) properly deferred to Phase 2
- Each epic delivers tangible, deployable value
- 4 epics with 26 stories is achievable in 3-4 month timeline for solo developer or small team

**Well-Scoped Features:**
- Content management via headless CMS (reduces development time)
- Static generation with ISR (performance without complexity)
- Client-side search (simpler than server-side for MVP)
- Basic analytics (learning without over-engineering)

**No Features Requiring Removal:** All features directly support the core mission and differentiation strategy.

**No Missing Essential Features:** The PRD covers all aspects needed for a functional, professional MVP.

### Technical Readiness

**Clarity of Technical Constraints:** Excellent
- Technology stack fully specified (React, Next.js, TypeScript, Contentful, Vercel)
- Architecture approach clearly defined (JAMstack)
- Repository structure decided (monorepo)
- Testing strategy established (unit tests for MVP)
- All decisions include rationale

**Identified Technical Risks:**
- **Content Source Dependency:** Reliance on Contentful means initial content creation is a dependency. Mitigation: Story 1.3 creates sample content early, and content can be created in parallel with development.
- **Image Sourcing:** How to obtain 50+ high-quality cat images noted in brief as open question. Recommendation: Address in architecture phase (stock photos, user-generated, original photography).
- **SEO Competition:** Noted in brief. Mitigation: Focus on quality content and professional UX as differentiators.

**Areas for Architect Investigation:**
1. **CMS Selection Confirmation:** Validate Contentful free tier limits meet MVP needs (entries, API calls, bandwidth)
2. **Image Hosting Strategy:** Confirm Cloudinary free tier sufficient or evaluate alternatives (Vercel native, imgix)
3. **Search Performance:** Validate Fuse.js client-side search performs well with target content volume (50+ articles)
4. **Lighthouse Score Targets:** Ensure 90+ scores achievable with chosen stack and design complexity

### Recommendations

#### Ready to Proceed
The PRD is comprehensive and ready for the Architect agent. No blocking issues identified.

#### Suggested Next Actions
1. **Initiate Architecture Phase:** Hand off to Architect agent to create detailed technical architecture
2. **Content Strategy:** Begin sourcing or creating initial 10 articles and 50 gallery images (can parallel-track with development)
3. **Contentful Setup:** Create Contentful account and configure content models per Story 1.3 early to unblock development
4. **Design System:** Consider creating basic color palette and typography choices before Epic 1 implementation to ensure consistency

#### Optional Enhancements (Non-Blocking)
1. Add user flow diagram for primary journey (Home → Category → Article → Related Article)
2. Add high-level architecture diagram showing CMS → Next.js → Vercel flow
3. Consider lightweight user feedback mechanism (e.g., "Was this article helpful?" yes/no) for qualitative learning

### Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The problem is clearly defined, MVP scope is appropriate, user stories are well-formed with testable acceptance criteria, and technical constraints are clearly communicated. The Architect can proceed with confidence.
